  <h1>Synthetic Social Science Group</h1>
  <h2>University of Oxford</h2>

  <p>
    The Synthetic Social Science Group is a new interdisciplinary working group at Oxford that explores the frontiers of computational modelling and generative AI for the social sciences. We meet regularly during term-time and welcome researchers from across the university and beyond who are interested in large language models (LLMs) for social science, agent-based models (ABMs), generative social science, human-computer interaction, and the construction of artificial societies.
  </p>

  <p>
    The group features both a reading group and a working group. Reading group sessions will feature guided discussions of new texts and methods in this emerging field or a practical session to try out implementing the previously discussed approach. Working group sessions will feature a mix of invited speakers and work-in-progress presentations from group members.
  </p>

  <p>
    The group brings together perspectives from political science, sociology, computer science, philosophy, and beyond, with the goal of building a space for exploring the theoretical and empirical challenges posed by synthetic agents and computational simulations of society.
  </p>

  <p>
    Attendance is open to graduate students, researchers, and academic staff. If you are interested in joining, please <a href="https://forms.gle/xxLLnZufvnu9cWAg7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fill out this form</a> or contact Emma Madden (<a href="mailto:emma.madden@politics.ox.ac.uk">emma.madden@politics.ox.ac.uk</a>) to be added to the mailing list and receive the term card.
